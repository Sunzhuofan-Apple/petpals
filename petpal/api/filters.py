            "reason": "reason for the score"
        }},
        ...
    ]

    Note:
    - Return only the JSON object for easy parsing.
    - Each pet is identified by its "pet id", which serves as the top-level key.
    - For each "pet id", ensure provide: score and reason.

    Rules:
    Please sort the following pets for the targeted pet by calculating a total score based on the following criteria:
    1. Same or similar breed as the targeted pet adds +3 points.
    2. Each matching or similar characteristic adds +2 points.
    3. Pets located in the same area as the targeted pet add +2 points.
    4. If the character of another pet conflicts with any of the targeted pet's red flags, subtracts -3 points.
    5. Provide a **detailed explanation** for each score, including:
    - Matching or similar characteristics.
    - Location relevance (same area or not).
    - Mention which character or characters conflicts with targeted dog's red flags and how they affected the score.
    6. Return pets from high score to low and resolve ties in score by prioritizing pets with fewer red flags.

    About "red flags":
    - "Red flags" do not describe the attributes of a pet itself.
    - Instead, they indicate behaviors or attributes that mean the pet does not want to interact with other pets having those attributes.
    - For example, a red flag "Big Dog" on a pet means the pet does not prefer to play with larger dogs.

    The targeted pet's information is as follows:
    {target_pet}

    The pets to consider for friendship are as follows:
    {pets_data}

    Return the filtered and prioritized result strictly in the JSON format specified above.
