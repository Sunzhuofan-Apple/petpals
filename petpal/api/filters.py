    ]

    Note:
    - Return only the JSON object for easy parsing.
    - For each entry, ensure provide: id, score and reason.

    Rules:
    Please sort the following pets for the targeted pet by calculating a total score based on the following criteria:
    1. The score is between 0.0 and 100.0, with higher scores indicating a better match. The following situations will help higher scores:
    - Same or similar breed adds 10.0 to 20.0 points.
    - Same preferred time add 10.0 points.
    - The more sharing or similar characters, the higher the score. Adds 0.0 to 20.0 points.
    - The closer the location, the higher the score, adding points from 0.0 to 20.0. If the city is not the same, the score will be reduced by 20.0 points.
    - According to the red flags, focus on the targeted pet's red flags. If the characters or other attributes of a pet matches the targeted pet's red flags, the score will be reduced. The more things match, the lower the score. The score will be reduced by 0.0 to 20.0 points.
    - Provide a **detailed explanation** for each score, including:
        - Matching or similar characters.
        - Location relevance (same area or not).
        - Mention which character or characters conflicts with targeted dog's red flags and how they affected the score.
    - Return pets from high score to low and resolve ties in score by prioritizing pets with fewer red flags.
    2. The total score should be rounded to one decimal place, from 0.0 to 100.0, not too tidy with the data.

    About "red flags":
    - "Red flags" do not describe the attributes of a pet itself.
    - Instead, they indicate behaviors or attributes that mean the pet does not want to interact with other pets having those attributes.
    - For example, a red flag "Big Dog" on a pet means the pet does not prefer to play with larger dogs.

    The targeted pet's information is as follows:
    {target_pet}

    The pets to consider for friendship are as follows:
    {pets_data}

    Return the filtered and prioritized result strictly in the JSON format specified above.
